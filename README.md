When players launch the game, they will play as a little knight adventuring in a virtual world, and players can start running exercises at any time. The game primarily guides players through voice prompts during their run, while players can also check the app screen for information at any time. During gameplay, players will encounter various fantasy monsters or challenges, which they must overcome through real-world running time competitions or running distance.
